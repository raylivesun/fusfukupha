```c++
struct Frame1 {
  byte a[95];
  byte b[760];
  byte c[95];
};
```

**Explanation:**

This code defines a `struct` (structure) named `Frame1`.  A structure is a user-defined data type that groups together variables of different data types under a single name.

* **`struct Frame1 { ... };`**:  This declares the structure named `Frame1`. The code within the curly braces `{}` defines the members of the structure.  The semicolon `;` at the end is crucial; it's required to terminate the structure definition.

* **`byte`**: This refers to an unsigned 8-bit integer. It's often used to represent raw data bytes.  You'll need to `#include` the appropriate header file to use `byte`.  The specific header depends on the compiler and operating system:

    * **C++ (Modern):**  `#include <cstdint>`  and use `std::uint8_t`  (recommended)
    * **Windows:** `#include <Windows.h>` (Note: `BYTE` is already defined in `Windows.h` so no need to re-declare)
    * **Other Systems (Older):** `#include <stdint.h>` and use `uint8_t`.  Alternatively, some compilers might define `byte` directly.

* **`byte a[95];`**:  This declares a member named `a` within the `Frame1` structure. `a` is an array of 95 `byte` elements.  So, `a` holds 95 bytes of data.

* **`byte b[760];`**: This declares a member named `b`, an array of 760 `byte` elements. `b` holds 760 bytes of data.

* **`byte c[95];`**:  This declares a member named `c`, an array of 95 `byte` elements. `c` holds 95 bytes of data.

**Example Usage:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint> // For std::uint8_t

struct Frame1 {
  std::uint8_t a[95];
  std::uint8_t b[760];
  std::uint8_t c[95];
};

int main() {
  Frame1 myFrame; // Create an instance of the Frame1 structure

  // Initialize some elements of the arrays (just as an example)
  myFrame.a[0] = 0x01;
  myFrame.b[10] = 0xFF;
  myFrame.c[94] = 0x55;

  // Accessing elements
  std::cout << "myFrame.a[0] = " << static_cast<int>(myFrame.a[0]) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "myFrame.b[10] = " << static_cast<int>(myFrame.b[10]) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "myFrame.c[94] = " << static_cast<int>(myFrame.c[94]) << std::endl;

  // Calculate the total size of the Frame1 structure in bytes
  size_t frameSize = sizeof(Frame1);
  std::cout << "Size of Frame1: " << frameSize << " bytes" << std::endl; // Output: Size of Frame1: 950 bytes

  return 0;
}
```

**Key Points:**

* **Memory Layout:** The members `a`, `b`, and `c` will be stored contiguously in memory (one after the other) when you create an instance of the `Frame1` struct.

* **Size:** The total size of the `Frame1` structure will be 95 + 760 + 95 = 950 bytes, assuming that `byte` represents a single byte (8 bits).  This is confirmed by `sizeof(Frame1)` in the example.

* **Padding:**  Compilers might add padding bytes between or after members to satisfy alignment requirements of the target architecture.  In most cases, this won't happen when using `byte` or `uint8_t` but it's worth noting that struct size calculation might be slightly different if you used larger data types (e.g., `int`, `double`). You can use `#pragma pack(1)` before the struct definition to force no padding, but this can sometimes hurt performance.

* **Purpose:** This structure is likely intended to represent a data frame, possibly from some communication protocol or hardware device, where data is divided into distinct sections.
